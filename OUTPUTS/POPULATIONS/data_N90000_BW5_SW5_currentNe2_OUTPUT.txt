# Running time:6.43137sec
#
# PREPROCESSING INFORMATION:
# A single population model is assumed with the possibility of considering the existence of full-sibs.
# The marker locations in a genetic map are known and the chromosome sizes and 
#   the total genetic size will be calculated using those locations. The genetic 
#   distances (in Morgans) between loci pairs will be calculated directly using
#   the locations in the genetic map.
# Ne will be inferred using the recombination rates between loci and the weighted cuadratic
#   correlations of alleles across all pairs of loci.
