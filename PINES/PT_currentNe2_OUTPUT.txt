# Running time:214.249sec
#
# PREPROCESSING INFORMATION:
# A single population model is assumed with the possibility of considering the existence of full-sibs.
# The marker locations in a physical map are known and the chromosome sizes and the
#   total genome size will be calculated using those locations. The physical map will be
#   converted into a genetic map using a constant recombination rate across the genome: 
#   distances in Morgans will be calculated using the physical distances (in Mb).
# Ne will be inferred using the recombination rates between loci and the weighted cuadratic
#   correlations of alleles across all pairs of loci.
#
# INPUT PARAMETERS:
# Number of chromosomes in the .map file:
12
# Genome size in Morgans:
14.33
# Total number of individuals in the input file:
16
# Effective Number of individuals included in the analysis (excluding missing genotypes):
15.92
# Number of SNPs in the input file:
14879
# Number of SNPs included in the analysis (only polymorphic and with less than 20% missing data):
4678
# Number of SNP pairs included in the analysis:
10939503
# Proportion of missing data:
0.00513970
# Number of full siblings that a random individual in the population has:
Not given
# Number of full siblings that a random individuals in the sample has:
Not given
#
# OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
# Observed d^2 of the entire sample (weighted correlation of loci pairs):
0.06342345
# Observed d^2 of the sample (only between different chromosomes):
0.06256558
# Observed d^2 of the sample (within chromosomes):
0.07253730
# Expected heterozygosity of the individuals in the sample under H-W eq.:
0.24524975
# Observed heterozygosity of the individuals in the sample:
0.25357147
# Observed F value in the sample (excess of homozygotes):
-0.03350809

# Ne estimation by integration over the whole genome.
# Based on 10939503 pairs of SNPs.
# Ne point estimate:
1314.94
# Lower limit of 50% CI:
805.35
# Upper bound of 50% CI:
2146.96
# Lower limit of 90% CI:
397.77
# Upper limit of 90% CI:
4346.91
# Estimated Number of full siblings that a random individuals has in the population:
0.00
#

The solution based on the LD between SNPs on different chromosomes does not converge. 

The LD data and the number of siblings are incongruent to each other.
