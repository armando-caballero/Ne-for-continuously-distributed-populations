#
# PREPROCESSING INFORMATION:
# A single population model is assumed with the possibility of considering the existence of full-sibs.
# The marker locations in a genetic map are known and the chromosome sizes and 
#   the total genetic size will be calculated using those locations. The genetic 
#   distances (in Morgans) between loci pairs will be calculated directly using
#   the locations in the genetic map.
# Ne will be inferred using the recombination rates between loci and the weighted cuadratic
#   correlations of alleles across all pairs of loci.
#
# INPUT PARAMETERS:

# Ne estimation by integration over the whole genome.
# Based on 6895041 pairs of SNPs.
# Ne point estimate:
348.05
# Lower limit of 50% CI:
348.05

# Upper limit of 90% CI:
348.05
# Estimated Number of full siblings that a random individuals has in the population:
Not estimated because F value is too large
