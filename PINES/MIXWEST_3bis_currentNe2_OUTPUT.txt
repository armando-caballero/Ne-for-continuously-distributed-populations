# Command: ./currentne2 -r 0.061 MIXWEST_3bis.ped
# Running time:456.044sec
#
# PREPROCESSING INFORMATION:
# A single population model is assumed with the possibility of considering the existence of full-sibs.
# The marker locations in a physical map are known and the chromosome sizes and the
#   total genome size will be calculated using those locations. The physical map will be
#   converted into a genetic map using a constant recombination rate across the genome: 
#   distances in Morgans will be calculated using the physical distances (in Mb).
# Ne will be inferred using the recombination rates between loci and the weighted cuadratic
#   correlations of alleles across all pairs of loci.
