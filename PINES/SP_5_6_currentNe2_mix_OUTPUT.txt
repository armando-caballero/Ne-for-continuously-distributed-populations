# (currentNe v 2.0)
# Command: ./currentne2 -r 0.061 -x SP_5_6.ped
# Running time:269.195sec
#
# PREPROCESSING INFORMATION:
# A metapopulation model of several islands of equal size and symmetrical migration is assumed.
# The marker locations in a physical map are known and the chromosome sizes and the
#   total genome size will be calculated using those locations. The physical map will be
#   converted into a genetic map using a constant recombination rate across the genome: 
#   distances in Morgans will be calculated using the physical distances (in Mb).
# Ne will be inferred using the recombination rates between loci and the weighted cuadratic
#   correlations of alleles of loci pairs at distances greater than 5 cM.
#
# INPUT PARAMETERS:
# Number of chromosomes in the .map file:
12
# Genome size in Morgans:
14.33
# Total number of individuals in the input file:
48
# Effective Number of individuals included in the analysis (excluding missing genotypes):
46.51
# Number of SNPs in the input file:
14879
# Number of SNPs included in the analysis (only polymorphic and with less than 20% missing data):
6541
# Number of SNP pairs included in the analysis:
21389070
# Proportion of missing data:
0.03105418
# Number of full siblings that a random individual in the population has:
Not given
# Number of full siblings that a random individuals in the sample has:
Not given
#
# OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
# Observed d^2 of the entire sample (weighted correlation of loci pairs):
0.02237872
# Observed d^2 of the sample (only between different chromosomes):
0.02240669
# Observed d^2 of the sample (within chromosomes):
0.02205027
# Expected heterozygosity of the individuals in the sample under H-W eq.:
0.18620985
# Observed heterozygosity of the individuals in the sample:
0.18455069
# Observed F value in the sample (excess of homozygotes):
0.00864845
# Ne cannot be estimated because the LD is smaller for linked than for unlinked markers.
