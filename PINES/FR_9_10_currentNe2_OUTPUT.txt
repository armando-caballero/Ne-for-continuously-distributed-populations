# Running time:225.278sec
#
# PREPROCESSING INFORMATION:
# A single population model is assumed with the possibility of considering the existence of full-sibs.
# The marker locations in a physical map are known and the chromosome sizes and the
#   total genome size will be calculated using those locations. The physical map will be
#   converted into a genetic map using a constant recombination rate across the genome: 
#   distances in Morgans will be calculated using the physical distances (in Mb).
# Ne will be inferred using the recombination rates between loci and the weighted cuadratic
#   correlations of alleles across all pairs of loci.
#
# INPUT PARAMETERS:
# Number of chromosomes in the .map file:
12
# Genome size in Morgans:
14.33
# Total number of individuals in the input file:
33
# Effective Number of individuals included in the analysis (excluding missing genotypes):
32.93
# Number of SNPs in the input file:
14879
# Number of SNPs included in the analysis (only polymorphic and with less than 20% missing data):
5094
# Number of SNP pairs included in the analysis:
12971871
# Proportion of missing data:
0.00224289
# Number of full siblings that a random individual in the population has:
Not given
# Number of full siblings that a random individuals in the sample has:
Not given
#
# OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
# Observed d^2 of the entire sample (weighted correlation of loci pairs):
0.03184773
# Observed d^2 of the sample (only between different chromosomes):
0.03059197
# Observed d^2 of the sample (within chromosomes):
0.04514860
# Expected heterozygosity of the individuals in the sample under H-W eq.:
0.21885930
# Observed heterozygosity of the individuals in the sample:
0.22129058
# Observed F value in the sample (excess of homozygotes):
-0.01098694

# Ne estimation by integration over the whole genome.
# Based on 12971871 pairs of SNPs.
# Ne point estimate:
698.52
# Lower limit of 50% CI:
566.78
# Upper bound of 50% CI:
860.88
# Lower limit of 90% CI:
419.58
# Upper limit of 90% CI:
1162.89
# Estimated Number of full siblings that a random individuals has in the population:
0.00
#

The solution based on the LD between SNPs on different chromosomes does not converge. 

The LD data and the number of siblings are incongruent to each other.
