# Command: ../currentne2 -x data1.ped
# Running time:167.098sec
#
# PREPROCESSING INFORMATION:
# A metapopulation model of several islands of equal size and symmetrical migration is assumed.
# The marker locations in a genetic map are known and the chromosome sizes and 
#   the total genetic size will be calculated using those locations. The genetic 
#   distances (in Morgans) between loci pairs will be calculated directly using
#   the locations in the genetic map.
# Ne will be inferred using the recombination rates between loci and the weighted cuadratic
#   correlations of alleles of loci pairs at distances greater than 5 cM.
